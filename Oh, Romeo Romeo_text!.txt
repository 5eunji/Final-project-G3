Many years ago, in the city of Verona, Italy, there were two families, the Montagues and the Capulets. 
These two families were always battling and did not like each other.   
    

One day, when Romeo Montague, who was a member of the Montague family, secretly went to a Capulet party.
There, he saw Juliet Capulet, whose family was one of the most influential families in Verona.
As soon as they saw each other, they fell in love. But their love was in danger because of the strong hate between their families.
After the Montagues left the party, Romeo went back to the Capulet house and hid outside Juliet’s window. Juliet stood at her window, whispering,

“Oh Romeo, Romeo! Where are you Romeo? Give up your family name, or if you won't, just promise to love me, and I'll give up being a Capulet."

Below Juliet's window, Romeo stood in the shadows of a wall. He looked up at her, his heart beating fast.
Romeo and Juliet promised to marry in secret and expressed their love for each other.
However, their secret was soon discovered, and the battling between the two families got worse.
Would Romeo and Juliet be able to keep their love? Let’s watch the play and find out!
